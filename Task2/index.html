                <p>One of Seven Wonders of the World, White Marble Mughal Architecture, the Taj Mahal was built by emperor Shah Jahan in the memory of his wife, Mumtaj Mahal. It is located at the bank of river Yamuna in Agra. It was completed in 1653 with the estimated cost of 32 million Indian rupees which would today stand up to 58 billion Indian rupees. It is considered as the best example of Mughal architecture worldwide and is called the “Jewel of Muslim Art in India”. This is probably the monument that is most recognised the world over for its association with the Indian heritage sites.A tradition relates that Shah Jahān originally intended to build another mausoleum across the river to house his own remains. That structure was to have been constructed of black marble, and it was to have been connected by a bridge to the Taj Mahal. </p>

    <p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, formerly known as the Victoria Terminus is the headquarters of Central Railway in Mumbai. It was built by Frederick William Stevens with the inspiration from Victorian Italianate Gothic Revival architecture and traditional Mughal buildings between the years 1878-1888 and gave Bombay the face of being the International Mercantile Port of India. In some ways, the plan of the terminal though it has Italian and Victorian-era elements reminds us of the Indian palace architecture and is an excellent example of the blending of an indigenous and western style of art. Due to several reasons such as pollution, traffic, construction work, etc., there have been reports of damages to this site. More work needs to be done to ensure the preservation of this heritage site.</p>
